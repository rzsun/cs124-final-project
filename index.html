<h1>CS 124 Project Wiki</h1>
<h3>Relatedness Estimator</h3>
<h4>About Me</h4>
My name is Zheng Sun. I am a 4th year CS major. During my time here, I have taken many CS classes, however, I have not taken many classes outside of my major. I took this class because I was interested in how CS can be applied to other fields - such as biology. Doing this project was very interesting to me because it let me use the knowledge I gained in my CS classes and apply it to a real world problem, such as determining if people are related based on their DNA.
<h4>Introduction</h4>
Related individuals share DNA. Siblings on average share ~50% DNA because they inherit many of the same SMPs from their parents. By comparing the SNPs of two individuals, we can reasonably estimate whether they are related or not. This project will use two algorithms, a baseline algorithm as well as a improved algorithm to determine if two individuals are siblings given their SNPs.
<h4>Goals</h4>
To create and implement an algorithm that can determine whether individuals are related given their SNP to a reasonable degree of accuracy. Also to learn more about the application of computer science on the field of genetics.

<h4>Week 5</h4>
<h5>Progress</h5>
I reviewed the lecture slides and thought about how to begin the project.
<h5>Grade</h5>
B
<h5>Plans for next week</h5>
Implement a baseline algorithm.
<h5>Problems</h5>
There were not any significant problems but beginning the project was a little difficult because of the open ended nature.
<hr>
<h4>Week 6</h4>
<h5>Progress</h5>
I implemented my data generation method to create a sample set for my data and began implementing the baseline algorithm.
<h5>Grade</h5>
C
<h5>Plans for next week</h5>
Implement a baseline algorithm.
<h5>Problems</h5>
I initially wanted to implement my baseline algorithm but implementing the data generation took longer than anticipated. I started implementing my baseline algorithm but was not able to complete it.
<hr>
<h4>Week 7</h4>
<h5>Progress</h5>
I finished my baseline algorithm and brainstormed ideas for my improved algorithm as well as began to write pseudo code.
<h5>Grade</h5>
A
<h5>Plans for next week</h5>
Implement my improved algorithm
<h5>Problems</h5>
This week I was able to accomplish a good amount this week. I finished my baseline algorithm as well as made good progress in beginning starting my improved algorithm.
<hr>
<h4>Week 8</h4>
<h5>Progress</h5>
I finished implementing my improved algorithm.
<h5>Grade</h5>

<h5>Plans for next week</h5>
Work on my presentation.
<h5>Problems</h5>
This week I encountered no problems.
